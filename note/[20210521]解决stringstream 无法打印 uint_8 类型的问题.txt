uint8_t can't be printed with cout


I have a weird problem about working with integers in C++.

I wrote a simple program that sets a value to a variable and then prints it, but it is not working as expected.

My program has only two lines of code:

uint8_t aa = 5;

cout << "value is " << aa << endl;
The output of this program is value is

I.e., it prints blank for aa.

When I change uint8_t to uint16_t the above code works like a charm.

I use Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), 64-bit, and my compiler version is:

gcc version 4.6.3 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5)



You have to convert aa to unsigned int to output the numeric value, since ostream& operator<<(ostream&, unsigned char) tries to output the visible character value.

uint8_t aa=5;

cout << "value is " << unsigned(aa) << endl;



Adding a unary + operator before the variable of any primitive data type will give printable numerical value instead of ASCII character(in case of char type).

uint8_t aa = 5;
cout<<"value is "<< +aa <<endl; // value is 5
